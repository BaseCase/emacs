* emacs sticky notes
  - with transient mark mode, TAB indents highlit region
  - M-! is shell command
  - 'mkdir' now, not 'make-directory'
  - proced
  - M-m goes to beginning of text on indented line (nice!)
** ido-mode rules
   - when in buffer menu, C-f goes to files menu (C-b to buffer when in file menu)
   - C-s cycles menu through visible choices
   - Enter selects current file/buffer, or goes down into current folder
   - backspace hops up a directory level
   - C-j creates new file/buffer matching text you entered (in case it also matches something)
   - there's more to it than this, but these are the basics
