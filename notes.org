* emacs sticky notes
  - with transient mark mode, TAB indents highlit region
  - M-! is shell command
  - 'mkdir' now, not 'make-directory'
  - proced
  - M-m goes to beginning of text on indented line (nice!)
  - M-w   kill ring save (w/o kill)
  - blink-matching-open
  - C-x C-o   ==  delete-blank-lines (leaving just one)
** ido-mode rules
   - when in buffer menu, C-f goes to files menu (C-b to buffer when in file menu)
   - C-s cycles menu through visible choices
   - Enter selects current file/buffer, or goes down into current folder
   - backspace hops up a directory level
   - C-j creates new file/buffer matching text you entered (in case it also matches something)
   - there's more to it than this, but these are the basics

** macros where have you been all my life
   - F3 / F4 == start / stop macro recording
   - C-x C-k e    edit macro
   - C-x C-k C-[p|n]   macro ring prev/next
   - C-x C-k b    bind macro to key (capital letters and numbers)
   - C-x C-k <<CHAR>>    execute macro bound to CHAR
   - C-x C-k n    name macro
   - C-x C-k C-v     view macro ring
** mark mode stuff
   - C-SPC C-SPC    set mark
   - C-x C-SPC    global pop mark
   - C-u C-SPC    local pop mark
