This is cjb's awesome and super-portable Emacs setup. You should just be able to slap it in your home directory and rock. There are just a couple of setup steps:

1. Create a .emacs that has the following two lines:
   (add-to-list 'load-path <<LOCATION OF EMACS DIR>>)
   (require 'emacs-config)

2. Change default font if needed (but Consolas is so pretty)

3. Change cjb-load-path variable in load-path-config.el to point to location of config folder

--If...
...you want Python, 
       1. run 'python setup.py install' from the PyMacs directory
