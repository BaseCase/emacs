This is cjb's awesome and reasonably portable Emacs setup. You should nearly just be able to slap it in your home directory and rock. There are just a couple of setup steps:

1. Create a .emacs that has the following two lines:
   (add-to-list 'load-path <<LOCATION OF EMACS DIR>>)
   (require 'emacs-config)

2. Change default font if needed (but Consolas is so pretty)

3. Change cjb-load-path variable in load-path-config.el to point to location of config folder

4. Check out emacs-config.el for the main config file...you can use this to turn on/off stuff you want.



If...
...you want org-mode,
       1. cd to emacs folder
       2. git submodule init
       3. git submodule update

...you want Python, 
       0. rm -rf pymacs
       1. git submodule update
       2. run 'python setup.py install' from the PyMacs directory
       3. run 'python setup.py install' from the rope directory
       4. run 'python setup.py install' from the ropemacs directory
       5. I should probably make a script that can do this...
       6. Bask in the glory



Yeah, I know I need to make some kind of script that takes care of setup for different platforms and whatnot. I'll do it someday...
