Casey's Emacs setup. It's a little more complicated-looking than just a straight .emacs file, but this way makes it a lot more manageable in the long run. To set it up:

1. Create a .emacs in your ~ that has the following two lines:
   (add-to-list 'load-path <<LOCATION OF EMACS DIR>>)
   (require 'emacs-config)

2. Change 'cjb-load-path variable in load-path-config.el to point to this folder


*emacs-config.el* is the main control panel. From here you should be able to turn all the major stuff on and off. For finer-grained control, check the *XX-config.el* files.


_(other notes)_

If...

...you want Python, 
  1. run 'python setup.py install' from the PyMacs directory
  2. run 'python setup.py install' from the rope directory
  3. run 'python setup.py install' from the ropemacs directory
  4. I should probably make a script that can do this...
  5. Bask in the glory

...you're using Cygwin,
  1. uncomment the require line in emacs-config.el

...something happens that I haven't accounted for here,
  1. it is because I'm way lazy.
